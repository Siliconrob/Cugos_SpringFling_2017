All data from the [King County GIS Data Portal](http://www5.kingcounty.gov/gisdataportal/)
This repo is modified from [Emilio Mayorga's Maptime Geopandas Tutorial] (https://github.com/MaptimeSEA/geopandas-tutorial-maptime).

### Getting Started

*If you are familiar with github, fork and clone [the repository](https://github.com/christyheaton/Cugos_SpringFling_2017).

*If not, download the repository and unzip to a working directory.

*Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) for your operating system. Please choose the Python 2.x version of Miniconda as not all packages we'll be using are Python 3-compliant.

*Open your Anaconda prompt. Navigate to the directory containing environment.yml.

```bash
conda env create environment.yml  # Will create an environment called "geopandasenv"
source activate geopandasenv  # OSX and Linux
activate geopandasenv  # Windows.
```

*In your Anaconda command line with the geopandasenv activated, type in:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

*Click on SpringFling.ipynb and off we go!
